At times this has\\n\\nmeant forging our own path and investing across stages and asset classes, which\\n\\ncan sometimes be a lonely road. But we’ve also tried to create room for others to\\n\\neither partner alongside us or copy something that works. Ultimately, our\\n\\ninvestments are judged on whether they worked or not from time of entry to time\\n\\nof exit.\\n\\nAll of this said, while this approach has led us to explore different areas of\\n\\ntechnology and a range of capital raising tools, we believe there has been a\\n\\ncommon theme that has defined our work over the past 12 years: partnering with\\n\\nambitious, independent thinkers who as founders are building companies from\\n\\nfirst principles. Ideally, when everything converges, we have historically been able\\n\\nto achieve both meaningful societal progress and meaningful commercial\\n\\noutcomes.\\n\\nBuilding companies in an age of austerity\\n\\nCurrently, we find ourselves navigating one of the most complicated environments\\n\\nof the past 20\\x00 years of technology investing.\\n\\nhttps://chamath.substack.com/p/2022-annual-letter#footnote-anchor-4-108054412\\n\\n2/27\\n\\n\\x0c8/11/23, 6:36 PM\\n\\n2022 Annual Letter - Chamath Palihapitiya\\n\\nIn our 2021 annual letter, we wrote that the formula for successful technology\\n\\ninvesting must include founders who have the discipline to be hyper-focused on\\n\\nthe things that will help their businesses succeed, balanced with the ability to\\n\\nignore noise and distractions, no matter how difficult or unpopular. When done\\n\\nwell, these specific founders have shown great ability to deliver outsized\\n\\noutcomes for their customers, employees, and investors.\\n\\nHowever, on the cusp of a generation-defining economic regime change, many of\\n\\nus hadn’t adequately considered a key factor, which up until 2022 has been often\\n\\nforgotten or overlooked: austerity.\\n\\nAs we enter a sustained period of non-zero interest rates, discipline of mission\\n\\nmust now also intersect with discipline of management and operation.\n",
